üéØ PROJECT TITLE: Mini Student & Shopping System (Beginner Python Revision)

üìù DESCRIPTION:
This program is designed to revise all the basic Python concepts in one small project.
It simulates a simple shopping system for students, where a user can:
- Enter their name and age
- Check voting eligibility using if/elif/else
- View and select fruits from a list
- Use a while loop to add items to their cart
- View special offers (tuple)
- Store their details in a dictionary
- Choose a payment method using match-case
- Perform string operations like upper, lower, length
- Get a final confirmation message

üí° CONCEPTS USED:
1. Input and Type Conversion (int, str, float)
2. Conditional Statements (if, elif, else)
3. Loops (for loop and while loop)
4. Match Case (Python 3.10+)
5. List operations (displaying fruits, adding to cart)
6. Tuple (displaying offers)
7. Dictionary (storing student details)
8. String Operations (upper, lower, len)
9. Basic logical thinking and control flow

‚úÖ WHAT YOU SHOULD PRACTICE:
- Change the fruits or add more products
- Add discounts or price calculation
- Add multiple students (list of dictionaries)
- Add input validation
- Use f-strings creatively to display messages

üöÄ PURPOSE:
To build confidence in basic Python programming by combining all beginner-level topics
into one practical, simple project that can be extended later.
