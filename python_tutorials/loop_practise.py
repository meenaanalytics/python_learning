# 🏋️ 1. For Loop
# Write a for loop to print numbers from 1 to 10.
# 📝 Hint: Use range(1, 11).

# for i in range(1 , 11):
#    print(i)


# 🧮 2. While Loop
# Keep asking the user to enter their favorite number until they enter 0.
# When they enter 0, print "Goodbye!".
a = 8
while a !=0:
    a = int(input("enter the number : "))
    print(a)

print("good bye")
 


# 🍎 3. For Loop with a List
# Create a list of fruits (apple, banana, mango, orange)
# Use a for loop to print:

# fruits = ["apple" , "ornage" , "grapes" , "lichi" , "pineapple"]
# for fruit in fruits:
#     print(fruit)






# 🕹️ 4. While Loop with Condition
# Start with a variable count = 5.
# Use a while loop to count down to 1, then print “🚀 Lift Off!”
# 📝 Hint: count -= 1 will help you reduce the number each loop.

# count = 5
# while count  !=1:
#     count = count - 1
#     print(count)

# print("good bye")
